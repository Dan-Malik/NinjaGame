SAVING SYSTEM

PreferenceManager currently initialises with 1 level unlocked and music and sound on.
Need to set Player object so on collision with door, preferencemanager updates the levels unlocked,
and you get returned to the level screen.

Additionally implement checks for music settings at each screen, and play music appropriately.
Sound Effects are only relevant for the PlayScreen.
