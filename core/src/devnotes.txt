!! GAME STOPPED WORKING ON ANDROID AFTER SAVE GAME WAS IMPLEMENTED, THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AS A PRIORITY

Possible solutions involve tweaking LibGdx preferences to get them to work with Android, alternatively could switch back
to using JSONs as previously planned.


//////

Level Components so far:
SolidPlatform
HollowPlatform
Spikes


To implement:
Crumbling platform (for hollowPlatform)
More hazards:
Fire
Arrows
Lock and Key?


Logic for exit door


///
SAVING SYSTEM

PreferenceManager currently initialises with 1 level unlocked and music and sound on.
Need to set Player object so on collision with door, preferencemanager updates the levels unlocked,
and you get returned to the level screen.

Additionally implement checks for music settings at each screen, and play music appropriately.
Sound Effects are only relevant for the PlayScreen.
