LEVEL SYSTEM

LevelScreen displays the buttons for the levels - as well as the style for the button needing
proper configuration, the system for unlocking levels needs to be set.

Game state needs to be saved to a json. Game state will include what levels are unlocked and settings
for sound and music (booleans)

LevelScreen should scan this Json and unlock/show buttons based on how many are unlocked.

On starting the game the JSON should be scanned for. If it doesn't exist a default JSON is created with
level 1 unlocked and sound and music on.
